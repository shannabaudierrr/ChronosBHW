I started with the idea of the many food items potatoes are made into. I then expanded to the many root vegtables. I combined both concepts in creating root vegetables as the different unhealthy foods created from potatoes. I used logos to visually represent the company/food item, but left out the actual name of company to display how visuals can help you percieve something without words.</div>
